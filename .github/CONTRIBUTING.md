# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you to all the contributors who have helped make this project possible! We welcome various types of contributions, such as bug reports, documentation improvements, feature requests, and code contributions.

## Contributing Guidelines

If the feature you would like to contribute has not already received prior approval from the project maintainers (i.e., the feature is currently on the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/Jay-Thesia-Xone/projects/1)), please submit a request in the [Feature Requests & Suggestions category](https://github.com/xonevn-ai/xoneai/discussions/new?category=feature-requests-suggestions) of the discussions board before beginning work on it. The requests should include specific implementation details, including areas of the application that will be affected by the change (including designs if applicable), and any other relevant information that might be required for a speedy review. However, proposals are not required for small changes, bug fixes, or documentation improvements. Small changes and bug fixes should be tied to an [issue](https://github.com/xonevn-ai/xoneai/issues) and included in the corresponding pull request for tracking purposes.

Please note that a pull request involving a feature that has not been reviewed and approved by the project maintainers may be rejected. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

If you would like to discuss the changes you wish to make, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/c7qzCDt4), where you can engage with other contributors and seek guidance from the community.

## Our Standards

We strive to maintain a positive and inclusive environment within our project community. We expect all contributors to adhere to the following standards:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with these standards.
